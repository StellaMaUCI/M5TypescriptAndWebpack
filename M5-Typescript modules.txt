Deliverable: a Zip file containing:
A pdf or text file containing a description of the environment that you used to test your code
(at least operating system and computer architecture), a short description of how you would test your code
to make sure it would work for the majority of the users using your web page,
and a short description or list of what advanced TypeScript features you are using in this assignment
and a one-paragraph description of what you can do to debug TypeScript codes.
The file containing the complete source code of your TypeScript programs.
The Webpack project that you created.

Description of testing: 
First, Functionality Testing will be done. I got local running on Google Chrome, PyCharm browser, Safari, Firefox browser, Opera browser.
Second, I would like to use the automated testing tool Selenium to simulate testing in a different environment, for example, Node and browser versions, OS versions, etc. 
Lastly, I will get my classmates to do A/B testing for my webpage.
This should satisfy the majority of users' needs. 


TypeScript features:
1. Typescript adopts the basic building blocks of your program from JavaScript.
All TypeScript code is converted into its JavaScript equivalent for the purpose of execution.
I did this with:
$npm install typescript
$tsc app.ts
Then app.ts created a file app.js, but app.js didn't show in my project, then I changed its name back and forth, then it shows.
For example, I put "<script src="app.js"></script>" in a .html file, just as I did with javascript.

2.JavaScript is TypeScript. This means that any valid .js file can be renamed to .ts and compiled with other TypeScript files.

3.TypeScript is portable. TypeScript is portable across browsers, devices, and operating systems.
It can run on any environment that JavaScript runs on. Unlike its counterparts, TypeScript doesnâ€™t need a dedicated
VM or a specific runtime environment to execute.
